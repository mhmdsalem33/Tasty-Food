# Tasty-Food
Navigation component : one activity contains multiple fragments instead of creating multiple activites. Retrofit : making HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin/Java object. Room : Save meals in local database. MVVM &amp; LiveData : Saperate logic code from views and save the state in case the screen configuration changes. Coroutines : do some code in the background. view binding : instead of inflating views manually view binding will take care of that. Glide : Catch images and load them in imageView.
